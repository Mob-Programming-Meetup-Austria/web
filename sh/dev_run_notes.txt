If you are working on web-service there are 3 ways of
getting feedback on your local work:

1) /build_test_tag_publish.sh
   This runs a local server, using commander, but substitutes the
   locally build web image. The slowest option, but very very close
   to how it actually runs.

2) /sh/dev_run_copied_server.sh
   This runs a local server but does not use the commander service.
   Instead it uses docker-compose, versioner, and its own docker-compose
   yml files. The web image is rebuilt from source.
   A lot quicker than using commander (1), but not how a local server
   actually runs. A good (short) feedback loop for eg CSS tweaking.

3) /sh/dev_run_volume_mounted_server.sh
   This runs a local server but does not use the commander service.
   Instead it uses docker-compose, versioner, and its own docker-compose
   yml files. The web image is _not_ rebuilt from source, instead the
   web source is volume-mounted into the web container.
   You cannot use this option to edit code and then just refresh in the
   browser (because the web service runs in production mode which caches).
   However, you can run script (3) (which brings up a web-container),
   then edit code, then then re-run, directly,
     sh/run_tests_in_container.sh
   which runs tests inside the already running web container.
   The fastest feedback.

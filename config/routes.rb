  # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):

  #     member do

  #     resources :products

  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"

  # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
  # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.

# kata.update() can be refactored
#
# starter.old_manifest() can be retired in favour of
# starter.updated(manifest) which returns an updated manifest.
#
# As an optimization, keep the two ifs. So kata.update becomes

  def updated(manifest)
    if manifest['unit_test_framework'] || manifest['runner_choice'].nil?
      manifest = starter.updated(manifest)
    end
    manifest
  end

# refactored to

  def updated(manifest)
    if old?(manifest)
      manifest = starter.updated(manifest)
    end
    manifest
  end

  def old?(manifest)
    if !manifest['unit_test_framework'].nil?
      # change #1: before manifest became self-contained it has
      # to retrieve information from start-point  (bad coupling)
      return true
    end
    if manifest['runner_choice'].nil?
      # change #2: added runner_choice as required parameter
      return true
    end
    return false
  end


# Either way, starter.updated() must check for _both_ conditions one after the other

IDE's have a lot of richness in the way devs create code.
But they have a lot less richness in the feedback of the
results of that code.
I would like cyber-dojo to try to be richer in its feedback.
Have two modes:

- INPUT
  - a [test] button which takes you to OUTPUT
  - [new file] [rename file] [delete file] buttons
  - the source files in alphabetical order
  - no stdout/stderr/status

- OUTPUT
  - a [resume] button which takes you back to INPUT
  - a single traffic-light (not the full sequence)
  - no traffic-light < > navigation
  - no diff check-box
  - no fork/revert/download buttons
  - at the _top_, stdout/stderr/status in plain view (not diffed)
  - below sss, a diff view of the source files

A good first step in preparing for this would be to
cyber-dojo.sh/makefile/etc back into the main filelist
and have only stdout/stderr/status below that.

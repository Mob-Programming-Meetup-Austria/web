app/controllers/id_rejoin_controller.rb:
  # TODO: what if there is no completion
  # I've check in browser - if there is no completion for 6 digits
    then you can enter the 7th digit and it will complete.
  # But, Id prefer to make id-generator ensure the id is unique

app/controllers/id_rejoin_controller.rb:
  # TODO: if there is no completion
  # storer's kata.completed(id) could return
  # the empty string '' which I could check for.
  # Then I would not need to call kata.exists?
  # which does another round-trip to the storer

when you create a new file, make sure the cursor is in it ready to type.

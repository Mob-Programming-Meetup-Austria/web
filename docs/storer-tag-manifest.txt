# Add storer.tag_manifest(kata_id, avatar_name, tag)
#
# This will return a full manifest WITHOUT an 'id'
# This will then need to be updated() see below.
# fork_controller will then pass this updated manifest
# to storer.create_kata()
# Storer cannot fully implement a tag_fork() method (with id)
# because it does not have access to the starter service on
# the main cyber-dojo server (which runs off two nodes).
# Use this instead of kata.fork_manifest()

It would be better if each traffic-light
simply stored its own tag (and we drop was-tag).

The previous tag would have to be calculated
and would depend on the mode, do you want to
see (are you seeing) just traffic-lights, or all events?

This would also mean singler.ran_tests() would
not need to return anything.

I would also like singler.ran_tests() to take tag as an argument.
This will help caching (cache server).
It will also mean I can directly append to the end
of the tags.json file
Viz, each line is a json
{ 'number' => 0, 'time' => [2018,10,4,10,45,32], 'event' => 'created' }
{ 'number' => 1, 'time' => [2018,10,4,10,45,57], 'colour' => 'red' }

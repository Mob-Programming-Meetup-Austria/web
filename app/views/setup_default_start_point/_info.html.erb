The starting files for your chosen language,test-framework are always
a function called
<code>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" target="_blank">
    answer
  </a>
</code>
that returns
<code>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" target="_blank">
    6 * 9
  </a>
</code>
and a test that expects
<code>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" target="_blank">
    42
  </a>
</code>
<br/>
<br/>
The starting files are <em>unrelated</em> to your
chosen exercise. They are simply an example to start you off.<br/>
<br/>
Tests must complete in ~15 seconds.

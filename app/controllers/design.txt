cyber-dojo is designed for group practice-sessions.
In this 'mode' URLs used to look like this...
   http://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/hVU93Kj8rq?avatar=tiger
The hVU93Kj8rq was a 10-digit group-id
and the avatar=tiger was your animal inside this group

In this 'mode' URLs also look like this...
  http://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/ym04AU

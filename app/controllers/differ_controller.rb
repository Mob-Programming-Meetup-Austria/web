  def diff
    # This currently returns events that are traffic-lights.
    # This matches the default event handling in the review-controller.
    # The review/diff dialog/page has been refactored so it
    # works when sent either just traffic-lights or the full set of events.
    # It does not yet have a way to select between these two options.
    # However if it is sent the full set of events it must drop event zero
    # (which is the _kata_ creation event). This is partly so that
    # the lowest index is 1 (one) and not 0 (zero) as it is not
    # clear how to cleanly handle a index of zero in diff-mode since it does
    # not have a previous index. It is also partly because it makes sense
    # for the events to correspond to actual kata/edit events.
    # So, in summary, if returning all the events you still need to do a
    #         events.shift

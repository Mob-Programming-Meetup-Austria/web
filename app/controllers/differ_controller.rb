  def diff
    # This currently returns tags that are traffic-lights.
    # The matches the default tag handling in the review-controller.
    # The review/diff dialog/page has been refactored so it
    # works when sent either just traffic-lights or the full set of tags.
    # It does not yet have a way to select between these two options.
    # However if it is sent the full set of tags it must drop tag zero
    # (which is the _kata_ creation time). This is partly so that
    # the lowest tag.number is 1 (one) and not 0 (zero) as it is not
    # clear how to cleanly handle a tag of zero in diff-mode since it does
    # not have a previous tag. It is also partly because it makes sense
    # for the tags to correspond to actual kata/edit events.
    # So, in summary, if returning all the tags the first line needs to be
    #         tags = avatar.tags.map(&:to_json)
    #         tags.shift
    tags = avatar.lights.map(&:to_json)

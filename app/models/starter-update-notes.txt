# TODO: Plan
# update() below can be refactored
# starter.old_manifest() can be renamed to
# starter.update(manifest) and return a manifest
# Further, in the second if it could be passed display_name
# directly. It would then see if it contained a comma.
# If so, it would split on the comma and join with -
# Perhaps it would be simpler still to just pass the
# whole manifest and drop both ifs?

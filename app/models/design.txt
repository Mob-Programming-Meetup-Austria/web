cyber-dojo is designed for group practice-sessions.
In this 'mode' URLs typically looked like this...
   http://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/hVU93Kj8rq?avatar=tiger
The hVU93Kj8rq was a 10-digit group-id
and the avatar=tiger was your animal inside this group
Underneath, the [group-id, avatar-name] mapped to a
kata with its own unique 10-digit kata-id.
Now, the URLs will redirect to something like this...
   http://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/mFL6se
where mFL6se is the 6-digit kata-id

cyber-dojo can also be used for individual practice-sessions.
In this 'mode' URLs also look like this...
  http://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/ym04AU
The ym04AU is a 6-digit kata-id with no associated avatar-name.
